>**About**

 `rcognita` is a framework for dynamic programming and reinforcement learning algorithm development, testing, and simulation. The framework offers a playground of ready presets consisting of agents (controllers) and environments (dynamical systems). The core of the framework is `regelum` - a flexible universe of interconnected modules realizing a learn-in-the-loop concept, i.e., learning on the fly via data generated by the system. A distinct feature of `regelum` is that the controllers and systems exist in the same universe, allowing one to assemble a single preset combining both types of entities.

# Introduction and Installation

[Introduction and Installation guildlines](docs\INTRODUCTION.rst)

# Re-produce some controllers
I created bash script where contains all the config. Users just need to run following bash script to launch according scenario

## Nominal control
```bash
source ./scripts/sim/launch_nominal.sh
```

## Stanley Control
```bash
source ./scripts/sim/launch_stanley.sh
```

## MPC for Differential Drive
### MPC only
```bash
source ./scripts/sim/launch_mpc.sh
```

### MPC with obstacle avoidance
```bash
source ./scripts/sim/launch_mpc_obs_avoidance.sh
```

## Run Hyperparameters
With options like 
`"nominal"`
`"stanley"`
`"MPC_1"`
`"MPC_2"`
, we can run make run automatically several scenarios with different hyperparameters.

```bash
python run_PRESET.py <your_option>
```
